crises
there
will
continue
to
be.
in
meeting
them,
wether
foreign
or
domestic,
great
or
small,
there
is
a
recurring
temptation
to
feel
that
some
spectacular
and
costly
action
could
become
the
miraculous
solution
to
all
current
difficlties.
a
huge
increase
in
newer
elements
of
our
defenses;
development
of
unrealistic
programs
to
cure
every
ill
in
agriculture;
a
dramatic
expansion
in
basic
and
applied
research
-
these
and
many
other
possibilities,
each
possibly
promising
in
itself,
may
be
suggested
as
the
only
way
to
the
road
we
wish
to
travel.
but
each
proposal
must
be
weighed
in
the
light
of
a
broader
considration:
the
need
to
maintain
balance
in
and
among
national
programs,
balance
between
the
private
and
the
public
economy,
balance
between
the
cost
and
hoped
for
advantages,
balance
between
the
clearly
necessary
and
the
comfortably
desirable,
balance
between
our
essential
requirements
as
a
nation
and
the
duties
imposed
by
the
nation
upon
the
individual,
balance
between
actions
of
the
moment
and
the
national
welfare
of
the
future.
good
judgment
seeks
balance
and
progress.
lack
of
it
eventualy
finds
imbalance
and
frustration.
the
record
of
many
decades
stands
as
proof
that
our
people
and
their
government
have,
in
the
main,
understood
these
truths
and
have
responded
to
them
well,
in
the
face
of
threat
and
stress.
but
threats,
new
in
kind
or
degree,
constantly
arise.
of
these,
i
mention
two
only.

in
the
councils
of
government,
we
must
guard
against
the
acquisition
of
unwarranted
influence,
whether
sought
or
unsought,
by
the
military-industrial
complex.
the
potential
for
the
disastrous
rise
of
misplaced
power
exists
and
will
persist.
we
must
never
let
the
weight
of
this
combination
endanger
our
liberties
or
democratic
proceses.
we
should
take
nothing
for
granted.
only
an
alert
and
knowledgeable
citizenry
can
compel
the
proper
meshing
of
the
huge
industrial
and
military
machinery
of
defense
with
our
peaceful
methods
and
goals,
so
that
security
and
liberty
may
prosper
together.
akin
to,
and
largely
responsible
for
the
sweeping
changes
in
our
industrial-military
posture,
has
been
the
technological
revolution
during
recent
decades.
in
this
revolution,
research
has
become
central;
it
also
becomes
more
formalized,
complex,
and
costly.
a
steadily
increasing
share
is
conducted
for,
by,
or
at
the
direction
of,
the
federal
government.
today,
the
solitary
inventor,
tinkering
in
his
shop,
has
been
overshadowed
by
task
forces
of
scientists
in
laboratories
and
testing
fields.
in
the
same
fashion,
the
free
university,
historically
the
fountainhead
of
free
ideas
and
scientific
discovery,
has
experienced
a
revolution
in
the
conduct
of
research.
partly
because
of
the
huge
costs
involved,
a
government
contract
becomes
virtually
a
substitute
for
intellectual
curiosity.
for
every
old
blackboard
there
are
now
hundreds
of
new
electronic
computers.
the
prospect
of
domination
of
the
nation's
scholars
by
federal
employment,
project
allocations,
and
the
power
of
money
is
ever
present
-
and
is
gravely
to
be
regarded.
yet,
in
holding
scientific
research
and
discovery
in
respect,
as
we
should,
we
must
also
be
alert
to
the
equal
and
opposite
danger
that
public
policy
could
itself
become
the
captive
of
a
scientific-technological
elite.
it
is
the
task
of
statesmanship
to
mold,
to
balance,
and
to
integrate
these
and
other
forces,
new
and
old,
within
the
principles
of
our
democratic
system
-
ever
aiming
toward
the
supreme
goals
of
our
free
society.
another
factor
in
maintaining
balance
involves
the
element
of
time.
as
we
peer
into
society's
future,
we
-
you
and
i,
and
our
government
-
must
avoid
the
impulse
to
live
only
for
today,
plundering
for
our
own
ease
and
convenience
the
precious
resources
of
tomorrow.
we
cannot
mortgage
the
material
assets
of
our
grandchildren
without
risking
the
loss
also
of
their
political
and
spiritual
heritage.
we
want
democracy
to
survive
for
all
generations
to
come,
not
to
become
the
insolvent
phantom
of
tomorrow.
during
the
long
lane
of
the
history
yet
to
be
written,
america
knows
that
this
world
of
ours,
ever
growing
smaller,
must
avoid
becoming
a
community
of
dreadful
fear
and
hate,
and
be,
instead,
a
proud
confederation
of
mutual
trust
and
respect.
such
a
confederation
must
be
one
of
equals.
the
weakest
must
come
to
the
conference
table
with
the
same
confidence
as
do
we,
protected
as
we
are
by
our
morel,
economic,
and
military
strenth.
that
table,
though
scarred
by
many
fast
frustrations
-
past
frustrations,
cannot
be
abandoned
for
the
certain
agony
of
disarmament
-
of
the
battlefield.
disarmament,
with
mutual
honor
and
confidence,
is
a
continuing
imperative.
together
we
must
learn
how
to
compose
differences,
not
with
arms,
but
with
intellect
and
decent
purpose.
because
this
need
is
so
sharp
and
apparrent,
i
confess
that
i
lay
down
my
official
responsibilities
in
this
field
with
a
definite
sense
of
disapointment.
as
one
who
has
witnessed
the
horror
and
the
lingering
sadness
of
war,
as
one
who
knows
that
another
war
could
utterly
destroy
this
civilization
which
has
been
so
slowly
and
painfully
built
over
thousands
of
years,
i
wish
i
could
say
tonight
that
a
lasting
peace
is
in
